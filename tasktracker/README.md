## Task Tracker

Simple task tracker CLI tool I've written to get more familiar with Java development and a Linux development enviroment. This was made as a challenge to not use any external libraries, which is why the Task List is a Java Serializable object instead of something human readable like JSON or YAML. I'm not super happy with the end result but I at least practiced some Java, which was the point.
